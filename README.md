# Got It Done

Small little project to organise my life and tasks that I need to get done.

Ideally, I want to create 1 singular place for all of my tasks that need to get done. In the past, I've used org-mode for this, however synchronising this up into an API isn't something that seems natural and I'd like to be able to:

1. Integrate with Amazon Alexa (something like "Alexa remind me to get toilet paper")
2. Get push notifications on my phone when a task is due (toilet paper is due this afternoon)
3. From the alexa application - see my list of todos that I need to do.
4. Hit a basic auth web URL which will show me my list of items remaining.
